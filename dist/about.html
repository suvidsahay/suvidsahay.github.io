                        I love to go through various open source tools and technologies. Although I haven't contributed
                        to open source softwares much, but I follow other's projects and try to learn from it.

                        This is something that grinds my brain. Solving problems with given time and memory constraints
                        is quite fascinating for me as it is the most important thing required by every software
                        developer.

                    <p>
                        I can play football for hours and hours. The reason I love this game is because it inculcates
                        the team work attitude and trust amongst your team mates.
